Assets folder:
 - Use for images, SVGs, animations, etc., that are imported into your React
   components.
 - These assets are processed by the build tool (e.g., optimized, hashed for
   cache busting).
 - You can import them directly in your JS/JSX/TSX files: import logo from
   './assets/logo.png';
